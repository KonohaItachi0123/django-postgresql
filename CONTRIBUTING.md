# Contributing to django-postgresql-dag

We would love your input! We want to make contributing to the project as easy and transparent as possible. We welcome...

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License](https://github.com/OmenApps/django-postgresql-dag/blob/main/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/OmenApps/django-postgresql-dag/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/OmenApps/django-postgresql-dag/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is a good example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a quality bug report. Here's [another good example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - They are specific!
  - Give sample code if you can that can be used to easily reproduce the issue. Ideally, strip out everything that does not pertain to the problem or which is not required to allow the smple to run.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

We *love* thorough bug reports.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We stick with Django's coding style, with the expection that we use black with line length up to 120. Naming, spacing, etc all follow Django's best practices.

## Git Commit Messages

To keep things consistent, please use the following guidelines:

- Use the present tense imperative ("Add feature to" not "Added feature to")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference relevant issues and pull requests as needed after the first line
- Provide enough detail after the first line to give necessary context, but don't feel obligated to write a novel

## Be Kind

This project is volunteer run. Please be kind in your discourse.
